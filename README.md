# Auto-Claim-Prediction
Predicting future auto claim 
To Predicts the probability that a driver will initiate an auto insurance claim in the next year.

Insurance companies charge a reasonable premium to the customers irrespective of their risk for filing an insurance claim. Inaccuracies in car insurance company’s claim predictions raise the cost of insurance for bad drivers and increase the price for bad ones. The project may help an insurance company in following ways:

Affluent customer: Company can attract the good drivers if it is doing the fair pricing. Loss ratio: Company can avoid specific customer/policies if they are at high risk of filing claim which in turn decrease loss ratio. Fair pricing: Company can charge the premium to the customers by their risk, and accurate prediction will allow them to tailor their prices further. Claim forecast: Claim is proportional to the number of risky customers, so company forecast the number of claims it could get next year which will help them to manage their fund better. Data Source:
